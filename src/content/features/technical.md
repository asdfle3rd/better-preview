The plugin is built on a modern technical stack, utilizing React and TypeScript for a stable and performant user interface. It integrates with standard WordPress REST APIs for handling revisions and respects all user permissions. A testsuite to validate the plugin works in your installation gets added to your Admin page. You can choose to run the suite in your active Installation or in Isolation using a portable Dolt database and fresh Wordpress Installation based on the Version you are using.
